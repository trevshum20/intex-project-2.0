# intex-project-2.0

This web app was created for a school project.

This website is designed to help combat the opioid crisis. It includes a few informational pages that give a short background on the opioid crisis. There are other pages that 
enable doctors around the USA to view the types of drugs that their colleagues are prescribing. Lastly, there is a page that uses an Azure Machine Learning model to predict the type of drugs any 
given doctor is likely to prescribe. This app ultimately would be useful for medical professionals, and was built with them in mind.

This is a python Django CRUD app that was deployed on Heroku and used a postgres database.
